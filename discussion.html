						<h2>Discussion on being an outstanding teacher</h2>
						<p>The core attributes</p>
					</header>

					<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/discussion.jpg" alt="" /></a>
					<p>One of the discussions I had the pleasure of being a part of in this subject was about, what attributes make up a good teacher. The discussion also centered around what's the difference between a good teacher and one that is outstanding. The content in the learning unit, articles I read online and the opinions I read of fellow students all pointed towards the fact that an outstanding teacher is one who goes beyond the call of duty to leave an indelible mark on their learners lives forever. An outstanding teacher is one who cares but disciplines, guides their learners with love and encouragement all the while making sure their learners reach their potential. .</p>

					<p>Many in the discussion touched on how there are many teachers who are good but few who are outstanding and are willing to go the extra mile. Students spoke of how teachers need to cater for the diverse needs of each learner, making sure the classroom is an inclusive environment. To many in the discussion a teacher does not only teach but performs a series of roles and some days they can be a nurse, a mother and a counsellor all in one day. We discussed how a good teacher imparts knowledge to their students regarding the curriculum whilst an outstanding teacher is one who makes the learning content relevant to their learners and engages them on a multi sensory level in their lessons. Outstanding teachers are always open to learning and improving within their career. They practice building up their learners' confidence, skills and knowledge by making learning fun and interesting. </p>

					<p>I enjoyed being part of the group discussion, I found it beneficial to learn from my fellow students, glean from their knowledge and collaboratively discuss and share our opinions in a friendly yet informative online environment. It was good to see how many shared the same opinion of how teaching is a calling and not just a job. Together it was realized how much of a role model a teacher is to the community they are involved in. The discussion was mature and I learnt a lot. </p>
