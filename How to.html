						<h2>How to teach effectively</h2>
						<p>Create multi sensory lessons:</p>
					</header>

					<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/How to.jpg" alt="" /></a>
					<p><b>There are 3 main learning styles and all learners can be divided into these categories:</b></p>

					<p><b>Auditory:</b><br>
					Information is best retained through speaking and hearing. They enjoy hearing and following instructions and recalling what they have learnt out loud. These learners may be musically talented and may benefit from musically stimulated environments.</p>

					<p><b>Visual:</b>	 Learns best through visual senses. This learner learns by seeing the information through reading, seeing images or visual objects. They are generally able to recall a lot of information and benefit from a lecture style teaching method. </p>

					<p><b>Kinesthetic:</b> These learners enjoy a hands on approach to learning, anything auditory and visual needs to be accompanied by a practical element in the lesson. They themselves enjoy demonstrating any new information they have learnt than just repeating it back to the teacher. These learners benefit from working in groups.</p>

					<p>In a class a teacher will have a variety of learning styles inherent to their learners. A teacher therefore needs to engage their learners on a multi sensory level for information to be imparted, comprehended and memorized successfully. Accompanying auditory information with music and song, visual stimuli like pictures, graphs and visual objects and allowing the learners to interact with this media perhaps through demonstration, practically means you are creating lessons that are speaking to your learners and their learning styles. Information is received through the senses and this is the way all learning takes place. The more senses there are involved the more engaging there is with the learning material. </p>

					<p><b>Relevant learning content:</b> speak to their life worlds 
As a teacher it is necessary to make learning meaningful. Help learners to understand why they need to learn their curriculum. The consequences of worthwhile learning are obvious, it means learners can apply their knowledge practically to their everyday situations. Choosing outdated themes and concepts is definitely not going to create a captivated classroom environment. Instead teachers should be teaching themes that all learners can relate to in their daily lives. For example a theme like transport is a theme that is very apt for South African children. Learners in our country travel far and wide to receive their education and see mods of transport vary. It is also good to educate more privileged learners about those who travel miles to school. A theme like transport can provide a host of learning activities like new vocabulary, maths problems, arts and crafts and even field trips. Relevant learning is fun learning making learning attractive and continuous. </p>

					<p><b>Make learning creative:</b>
Creative environments teach learners how to think freely for themselves without risk or fear. Creative thinking helps learners to solve problems, think out of the constraints of the box and to ask questions. The more questions that are asked the better because this means thinking is taking place. An uncreative classroom creates learners who are unthinking robots. To create a classroom like this the teacher needs to embrace lessons that allow for creativity. These would include opportunities for fantasy and imaginative  dramatic play, open ended and thought provoking question time after stories, informal discussion where learners can question and share their opinions, free art and creative areas, lost of unprescribed construction activities. During these moments at school learning is incidental, the more learners discover about themselves and their abilities the more the opportunities for creative expression.  </p>

					<p><b>Learning should be collaborative:</b> 
Teachers can easily get stuck in a rut when it comes to their learning materials. Teachers should always be learning from each other, the ever changing world around them and even from their students. As learners see how their teachers are always willing to learn, the learners themselves will open up to collaborative learning. Encouraging group work and sharing knowledge is important in an ever changing Information Age of the 21st century. Asking learners questions and asking them to do their own research, whether it just means asking their mum and dad, and having them return with information, is a fun and collaborative way to learn. Help learners to understand that the power of learning is in their hands too. This will create forward thinking and independent learners for our future.</p>

					<p><b>Technological lessons:</b>
In this digital age it is completely necessary to make sure your learners are tech savvy. Smart technology has allowed classrooms to become online learning environments, where learners are engaged on a multi sensory level and have opportunities to practice using technology interactively with each other and the teacher. Access to the Internet and some form of technical device, whether  laptops, computers, iPads, cellphones or Smart Boards is going to become a prerequisite for teaching. Teachers should be willing to learn and train in how to incorporate technology into their lessons to stay relevant. Technology in the classroom creates a collaborative and global minded environment, beneficial for learners and teachers too. </p>
					
					<p><b>Bilingual lessons:</b>
In a country like South Africa, ideally speaking teachers should be bilingual and so should lessons. It is important for our learners to be internationally relevant by speaking English fluently but not to the detriment that their mother tongue is forgotten. For many learners English is a second language and for some a first language. A teacher who can bridge the gap between these language barriers amongst students means learners can learn with ease and understanding. English should be prioritized from an international point of view however culturally all races should be able to speak English and at least one African language. At a foundation phase level, these teachers have the advantage of introducing a bilingual environment from young. </p>
