						<h2>Mission statement</h2>
						<p>Current goals</p>
					</header>

					<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/mission.jpg" alt="" /></a>
					<p>My mission as a foundation phase teacher is to love children equally and release their potential through the power of knowledge and education. My aim is to impact society by helping learners become assets to their communities. I believe every child has the right to safety and education and my mission to care enough for each of my learners in their journey of education. I aim to celebrate success and failure with learners as both are opportunities for learning. I aim to respect the privilege I have received in becoming a teacher and the values, duties and beliefs it requires to not only be a good teacher but to be an outstanding one. </p>

					<p><b>My beliefs for my learners:</b></p>
					<ul>
						<li>I believe learners should be respected as individuals with needs and dreams that are unique.</li>
						<li>I believe every learner has the right and the ability to learn and how they learn is as important as what they learn.</li>
						<li>I believe that classrooms need to be models of an inclusive society, where all learners, no matter their needs, are afforded equal opportunities to learn, grow and develop and release their potential.</li>
						<li>I recognise that learners need to learn in environments that are safe, encouraging and filled with learning opportunities.</li> 
						<li>I believe a classroom should require responsibility and respect between the learners and the teacher, as these are values that a successful society requires.</li>
						<li>I recognise that learning should be relevant and meaningful as it builds onto the blocks of existing knowledge and experiences.</li>
						<li>I believe learning should be fun and attractive so learners can be inspired and motivated to become lifelong students.</li>
						<li>I believe in high expectations for learners as they build on their successes at their own pace. </li>
						<li>I believed in the importance of the holistic development of each child, socially, physically, emotionally and academically.</li>
						<li>I believe in the inclusion of parents in the education if their children and the success of working together with parents in the journey of their children's education. </li>
						<li>I believe a loved learner is a secure learner, who is able to accomplish more than they ever could've dreamed.</li>
					</ul>

					<p><b>My beliefs for myself:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>I am a professional within my field who holds a great responsibility in aiding and shaping the future generation. </li>
<li>I believe that as a teacher I am a life long student.</li>
<li>As a professional I need to be continuously growing, learning and developing to improve within my profession.</li>
<li>I believe in knowledge and its power for myself and my learners, and that an educated nation can impact the world. </li>
<li>I believe in the process of aiding those in their journey of knowledge and self discovery. </li>
<li>I believe as a teacher I need to innovate and create lessons that can reach my learners and release their potential. </li>
<li>I recognise that at times I need to be not only a teacher but a nurse, a mother, a counsellor and an activist for the rights of children to fulfill my learners' needs.</li>
<li>I recognise the trust that is placed on me as a teacher to mould and help learners using education, I vow to never break this trust and to create a classroom that is safe and secure.</li>
