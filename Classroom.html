						<h2>Classroom observation</h2>
						<p>2 Days in a Grade R classroom</p>
					</header>

					<a href="#" class="image fit"></a>
					<p>I spent two days in a Grade R classroom at a preschool in the area where I live. It was a very enjoyable experience to be in the classroom amongst the learners and their teacher, I observed and learnt many things.</p>

					<p>Over the two days I was there I had a lot of opportunities to see the teacher at work and ask many questions. The teacher was so warm and friendly to me. Her attitude towards me was the same as to her learners, she was kind and gentle and approachable. Her passion for teaching was evident in the way she treated her learners and the way the classroom and school day was run. She spoke of her profession as an honour and with high regard of the importance of the Grade R year. </p>

					<p>The learners in the class seemed to really love their teacher, I witnessed many of them coming throughout the day to give a hug, ask a question or with tears about something that had happened during play time. It pointed out to me how approachable she was to her learners and how comfortable they felt towards her. I noticed how curious the class were during lesson times and how eager every single child was to participate and be asked a question. This too showed me that this was a class of confident learners who were eager to answer questions even if they were wrong. In the classroom learners were respected, loved and encouraged. It was evident to see their respect for their teacher, even amongst the more mischievous ones. </p>

					<p>The preparedness and thought the teacher gave to her lessons and to each activity was evident as the various interest and abilities of the learners were catered for. Every learner could find something to do, it made the classroom seem a very happy place. The teacher approached the different lessons with enthusiasm that was infectious to her learners.</p>

					<p>I would like to take these observations as a practical example of how I would like to be as a teacher one day. I hope to also be able to have enough knowledge and skills to impart important concepts of subjects to learners on a level they can understand, incorporating their senses with perseverance and patience until comprehension and understanding takes place. I hope to also teach with enthusiasm as this teacher did so I can inspire my learners on their education journey.</p>

					<p>However most importantly I hope to teach with love, patience, encouragement and the respect which each learner deserves so that they can flourish within my classroom into the best individuals that they can be.</p>
